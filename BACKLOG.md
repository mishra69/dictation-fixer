# DictFix – Improvement Backlog

---

## Suggested by user

- **Input auto-clear timer** — automatically clear the input box after a set period of inactivity, so returning to the app always starts fresh without having to manually delete old text

---

## Other ideas

- **Auto-process on dictation pause** — detect when the user stops speaking and trigger Fix It automatically, removing the button tap entirely
- **History** — session log of the last N corrections so the user can scroll back and re-copy previous outputs
- **Re-copy button** — dedicated copy icon on the output box for when auto-copy fails or the user wants to copy again
- **Share sheet on iOS** — use the Web Share API to send corrected text directly to Messages, Notes, etc.
- **Per-provider key memory** — remember a key per provider within the session so switching providers doesn't wipe the key field
- **Unit tests** — extract provider modules into testable JS modules with mocked API responses
- **Groq provider** — very fast inference, free tier
